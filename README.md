# sgi-enhanced-gtk3 v0.1

#### Description
Quick theme I tossed together using another sgi theme as a base. I disliked using the small square as a minimize button.
I replaced it with the application menu button. I also disliked the fact that no escape button exists on Irix GUI.
I modified the themes resource file to include a close button, I created an "irix" styled close button that is just
a plus (Essentially 2 of the application buttons in 1).

#### Features
- Irix like theme - xfce4 - gtk3 - (Tested with Xubuntu 16.04.x)
- Irix like Red cursor style
- Irix Icons
- Irix Wallpapers

#### Instructions

1) Copy "sgi-enhanced" from "theme" into your /usr/share/themes directory (sudo needed)

3) Copy "sgi" from "cursor" into your /usr/share/icons )(sudo needed)
